# Language Agnostic TESTing

Main goal of this project is to provide web-service that allows teachers to create programming courses with built-in interactive excercises.

This web-service supports tests for programs written in these languages:

* C
* C++
* Python
* Pascal
* Planned: Go, C#

# How it works

* ‚úâÔ∏è Web service receives solution  for specific task
* üî® Solution is built inside separate docker container
* üß™ If build succeeded, then solution is tested with various test cases
* üìä User receives test result

This testing system is "language agnostic" because:

* All input parameters is passed via standard input
* Result is received from standard output
* Teacher provides solution only in one language
* Output of all students' solutions will be compared against output of teacher's solution

Here are few examples of programs for this testing system:

* In C:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
    printf("%d",a+b);
}
```

 * In Python:

```python
n = int(input()) # Receive count
s = 0
for _ in range(n):
    s += int(input()) # Receive numbers n times
print(s) # Output addition result
```

> Yes I know about command line arguments, but I've built it this way, so programms still can be executed and tested manually as usual.
> 
> I don't consider that it's good idea to teach begginers in programming about command line arguments at first lesson.

# Requirements

* docker-compose
* Bash
* x86\_64 or aarch64 (RPi 4) compatiable architecture

# Architecture

Here are all services managed by docker-compose:

* üóÑ db - database PostgreSQL (postgres:latest)
* üìã redis - key-value storage Redis (redis:alpine)
* üï∏ web - web service written in Go, that:
	* Receives HTTP requests from clients
	* Authenticates clients with access token stored inside **redis**
	* Manages user and task related data stored inside **db**
	* Puts solution in **redis** queue and takes test results from there
	* Responds with test results to clients
* üèÉ runner - internal web service written in Python, that:
	* Takes solution from **redis**
	* Builds solution
	* Tests solution
	* Sends test result into **redis**
* üèó manage - container with Bash and Python scripts, that is used for:
	* Filling **db** with tasks
	* Testing **web** service

# API documentation

[Here](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kee-reel/LATEST/main/web/swagger.json) you can check out API documentation, provided in [web/swagger.json](/web/swagger.json)

API returns error codes described in [web/api/errors.go](/web/api/errors.go)

# Quick start

Copy `.env.example` file to `.env` (and modify default passwords if needed):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Build containers and run service test:

```bash
./utils/restart-and-test.sh
```

# Quick start explained

You can easily start web service with docker-compose:

```bash
./utils/run.sh up -d
```

After that you can manage web server via **manage** container. To open interactive bash shell inside **manage**:

```bash
sudo docker exec -it $(sudo docker ps | grep manage | cut -d' ' -f1) bash
```

(inside **manage**) Then you need to fetch tasks that you want to insert in **db**:

```bash
./fetch_tasks.sh
```

(inside **manage**) Tasks are ready, lets insert them into **db**:

```bash
python3 fill_db.py
```

(inside **manage**) All set, now we can try to send requests to web server by yourself or test server with script:

```bash
./test_service.sh
```

# Tests structure

Main purpose of this web service is testing of specific programms, so let's figure out how you need to set them up.

Tests is organized this way:

`"tests"` -> `project` -> `unit` -> `task`

* `"tests"` - folder in project root directory, that contains projects
* `project` - folder with arbitrary name, that contains units
* `unit` - folder with arbitrary name, that contains tasks
* `task` - folder with arbitrary name, that contains actual test data

`project`, `unit` and `task` folders contains file `desc.json`, that contains descripton for according folder. Here are neccessary fields for every folder type:

* `project`
	* "name" - human readable name of project
* `unit`
	* "name" - human readable name of unit
* `task`
	* "name" - human readable name of project
	* "position" - position inside unit when it will be presented to user
	* "desc" - text description that will help user to understant given task
	* "input" - format of input data for program
		* "name" - name of input parameter
		* "type" - type of passed values
		* "range" - range (from min to max) in which values for random tests will be generated
		* "dimensions" - if this field is not specified, then it is just single value, if value specified - it is specification of array size and dimensions. Each value specifies size of dimension. Examples:
			* [50] - programm could receive array from 1 up to 50 elements (size will be randomly generated in each test)
			* [10, 5] - matrix 10x5 (each size for each dimension will be generated randomly in range [1,10]x[1,5])
			* [3, 0] - if zero is specified, size will be the same as previous one (in given example, possible sizes for matrix are 1x1, 2x2, 3x3)
	* "output" - text description of output format

This is example of `desc.json` file for some `task`:

```json
{
	"name": "Add to array",
	"desc": "Add a number to all values in an array",
	"input": [
		{"name": "A", "type": "int", "range": ["-1000", "1000"]}, 
		{"name": "B", "type": "int", "range": ["-1000", "1000"], "dimensions": [50]}
	],
	"output": "Result of adding A to B"
}
```

Apart from `desc.json` file, task folder also must contain other files:

* `complete_solution.*` - file with source code of reference solution. Output of this file will be compared with incoming solutions - if output differs, than test of incoming solution fails
* `fixed_tests.txt` - file with tests for solution. It contains values that will be passed into both reference and incoming solutions
* `template.*` - file with template for solution. Contents of this file could be used on UI side, to provide user with sample code for easy start

I have [repository](https://github.com/kee-reel/latest-sample-project) with example project - you can use it for for reference.
